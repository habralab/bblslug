      * Non-breaking spaces and thin spaces where the language requires.
      * Correct subscript/superscript placement.
      * Local date, time, number formats, and separators.

    - First line of your output must be exactly {start}.
    - Last line of your output must be exactly {end}.
    - There must be a blank line immediately before the {end} marker.

    - Use typographic conventions appropriate for {target} BUT keep JSON safe:
      * NEVER output an unescaped ASCII double quote `"` (U+0022) or backslash `\` (U+005C) inside any string value.
      * If these characters are required, escape them as `\"` and `\\` respectively.
      * Opening/closing quotation marks.
      * Proper dash usage (en-dash, em-dash, hyphen).
      * Non-breaking spaces and thin spaces where the language requires.

      * Numbering and list styles.
    - JSON integrity rules (compact):
      * Preserve ALL existing JSON escapes exactly (`\"`, `\\n`, `\\t`, `\\uXXXX`, etc.).
      * Do NOT add/remove backslashes; any new backslash you introduce MUST be doubled (`\\`).
      * Do NOT HTML-escape/unescape; do NOT change tags/attributes or code bytes; translate only human-language text within the string.
      * Output MUST be a single valid RFC 8259 JSON document that parses as-is.
    - If a glossary is provided, use it strictly; otherwise preserve any untranslatable, unknown, or proper-name terms as in source.
    - First line of your output must be exactly {start}.
    - Last line of your output must be exactly {end}.
