When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of two things strikes us.  Either we see in them no constant difference, but every possible gradation of character; or we see several well-marked varieties co-existing under nearly the same conditions of life.  This is, I think, the case with our domestic pigeons, and in a less marked degree with our various breeds of dogs.  But the most interesting and most striking fact is the high degree of variability to which our domestic productions are subject.  Everywhere, throughout all time, every breed of our domestic animals and every variety of our cultivated plants, has been formed by the unconscious selection and accumulations of minor differences.  These differences owe their origin to the same cause which, acting on organic beings in a state of nature, gives rise to the different species and varieties which we behold in the world around us.
